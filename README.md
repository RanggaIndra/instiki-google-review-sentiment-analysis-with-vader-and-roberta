# INSTIKI Google Review Sentiment Analysis with VADER and RoBERTa

This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of Google reviews, leveraging sentiment analysis techniques using VADER and RoBERTa models. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, and model-based sentiment scoring.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze review distributions and ratings.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Tokenization and text processing using NLTK.

- Sentiment Analysis:

  - VADER: Rule-based sentiment scoring.

  - RoBERTa: Transformer-based sentiment analysis for high accuracy.

- Data Visualization: Insights presented through plots and charts.

## Installation
1. Clone this Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RanggaIndra/instiki-google-review-sentiment-analysis-with-vader-and-roberta.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```
