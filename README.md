# INSTIKI Google Review Sentiment Analysis with VADER and RoBERTa

On This project, I tried to do Sentiment Analysis on INSTIKI Google Maps Review, which, it is my campuss.

I use SerpAPI to scrape the Google Maps Review Data, I need some data like, Rating, Reviews Text, Date, & User.

> Fun fact on this project, I need to Translate every text data on every row one-by-one to be able to do the Analysis. It caused by, the original review is made in Bahasa Indonesia.

## Short review about the project results!
1. The review is dominated by Positive Review.
2. There's really big gap between 1 stars rate, and 5 stars rate(more dominant on 5 stars rating.
3. Compound score is dominated to be positive on 3 stars rating above.
4. There is 1 bias example where the text is said "Nice Campus", however the rating thast given is 1 stars rating.
